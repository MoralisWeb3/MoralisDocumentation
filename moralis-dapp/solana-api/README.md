### What is Solana API?

Solana API is a very powerful REST API for developers to fetch various kinds of data from the Solana Blockchain, which includes **fetching user token balances, fetching NFT metadata** and many more!

Since Solana API is a REST API, it can be called in any programming languages by default. This makes it easy to for developers to fetch Solana data throughout multiple apps and platforms.

For ease of use, the Solana API can be called using the Moralis SDK with just **a few lines of code**. You can find all of these powerful functions in the <mark style="color:green;">**`Moralis.SolanaAPI`**</mark> namespace in the Moralis SDK.

{% hint style="info" %}
To access Web3API, make sure to initialise the SDK by following the [**Connect with SDK**](../connect-the-sdk/) guide. **`Moralis.start()`** will automatically load the <mark style="color:green;">**`Moralis.SolanaAPI`**</mark> module.
{% endhint %}

The namespace is divided into two categories, depending on what is the main parameter for obtaining information:

{% content-ref url="account.md" %}
[account.md](account.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="nft.md" %}
[nft.md](nft.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="solanaapi.token.md" %}
[solanaapi.token.md](solanaapi.token.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
It's also possible to access all of this functionality through REST API from your own backend. Information about how to fetch data using `REST API` is described in the [REST API](../web3-sdk/moralis-web3-api-rest.md) topic. It has similar functionality as SDK.
